# @drizzle-utils/get-contract-instance

A tool for getting the contract instance from Web3. This requires the contract artifact JSON generated by Truffle (i.e. `truffle compile` and `truffle migrate`).

## Usage

```js
import getContractInstance from "@drizzle-utils/get-contract-instance";
import SimpleStorage from "./SimpleStorage.json";

// pass in web3 and contract artifact
const instance = await getContractInstance({
  web3,
  contractArtifact: SimpleStorage,
});
```
