className=\"border border-secondary shadow rounded\" style={{padding: 12, backgroundColor:'AliceBlue'}}>\n    <h5>Introduction</h5>\n    <p>This utility allows for two parties to enter into a transparent multi-payment agreement using either ETH or DAI. There are no constraints on the contract's value or number of payments. Each agreement is an\n    individually deployed smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain and exclusively controlled and managed by the two paying parties involved. </p>\n    <p>The parameters of the agreement are set when the contract is initiated. The main difference between a legacy paper contract and a DecentPay payment contract is that DecentPay contracts are controlled by code, and\n    cannot be manipulated once deployed. In addition, there are no legal fees involved in initiating a DecentPay payment agreement.</p>\n    <p>When work is promised in exchange for payment between two parties, especially those that do not know each other, a decentralized payment contract can ease concerns and build trust. The person doing the work, the <i>payee</i>,\n    can see that the <i>payer</i> not only posseses the funds to complete the entire contract, but is willing to lock the funds into the contract as a measure of good faith. The goal is to eliminate uncertainty,\n    delays, and fees involved in traditional payment systems.</p>\n    <p>Additional mechanics built into the contracts provide a way for the parties to dissolve the agreement in case things are not going as planned. The dissolve functions allow the <i>payer</i> to recover funds while giving the <i>payee</i> an opportunity to\n    be paid for completed work. In these contracts a worst case scenario is that the next payment is split between both parties, and the balance returned to the <i>payer</i>. This, of course, is assuming that the <i>payee</i> is keeping up with payment requests and not proceeding with new work until paid for the previous milestone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <div className=\"border border-secondary shadow rounded\" style={{padding: 12, backgroundColor:'AliceBlue'}}>\n    <h5>Instructions</h5>\n\n    <p>First, <i>payer</i> and <i>payee</i> must agree to some basic contract parameters: total value of the contract, total number of (equal) payments, and a cooldown timer, in days, that will be implemented before one party can dissolve the contract by force (more on this below).</p>\n    <p>Next, the contract is deployed. Anyone can deploy the contract as long as they know the contract paramters and the Ethereum addresses of the <i>payer</i> and <i>payee</i>. Note that the person deploying the contract inherits <b>no control</b> over the\n    contract unless the contract is deployed by the <i>payer</i> or the <i>payee</i>. </p>\n    <p>Once the payment contract is deployed, the paying party must first pre-deposit the full value of promised work into the contract. </p>\n    <p>Finally, when a contract is funded and active, a list of each payment will appear on the dashboard. Both parties can sequentially request and approve payments as working progress is made. First the <i>payee</i> will see a \"request\" button on the right hand side of the payment list. Once that payment is requested, the <i>payer</i> will then see a button on the right side of the payment\n    list that says \"approve\". When the payment is approved, the funds for that payment are transferred to the <i>payee</i>. This will continue for the total number of payments until the remaining balance of the contract is depleted and the <i>payee </i>\n     receives the full contract funds. A payment that has not yet been requested will be listed in red. Once requested but not approved it will change to yellow, and then after it is approved the payment will change to green.</p>\n    <h6>All contract functions are available through the contract dashboard which will be presented once the contract is deployed.</h6>\n    <p>Ready? Scroll up and input the contract parameters above, select your currency, and click \"Deploy Contract\".
